# Fish Detector

This is an implementation of the fish detection algorithm described by Salman, et al. (2019) [1]. The paper's reference implementation is available [here](https://github.com/ahsan856jalal/Fish-Abundance).


## Datasets

### Fish4Knowledge with Complex Scenes

This dataset [1,2] is comprised of 17 videos from Kavasidis, et al. (2012) and Kavasidis, et al. (2013).

Available [here](http://www.perceivelab.com/index-dataset.php?name=Fish_Detection). Use the "GT - KEY FRAMES" download link.

### Preprocessing Datasets

The videos are provided in the Flash Video (`.flv`) format, which is not widely supported. Use [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to convert files to AVI:

    for x in *.flv; do \
        ffmpeg -i "$x" -c:v mjpeg "$(echo "$x" | sed 's/flv/avi/'); \
    done
